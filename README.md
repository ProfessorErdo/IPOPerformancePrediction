# IPOPerformancePrediction

For a long period of time, the price of new stock in China exhcange markets rose without exception on the IPO day and the investors expected a high intial return. The good IPO performance is due to the heavy-handed regulations that result in suppresed IPO prices. More details about the China's exchange market development can be found at: https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Chinese-style.pdf

However, sicne the reforming of latest IPO regulations to a registration based system, the price of some new stocks started to decline on the IPO day. Specifically, the price of 688737 declined 6.09% in its IPO day (22nd Oct. 2021) and it intiates a new age for investors applying for the new stock.

As of 22nd March 2022, there are 161 new stocks listed in the China's exchange markets and 30 of their prices declined on the IPO day accounting for 20% of the total new stocks. As an investor of China's exchange markets, I tried to develop models to predict the IPO performance of new listing stocks with the basic information from: https://data.eastmoney.com/xg/xg/default.html

The models are developed based on tree-based methods, random forests, kNN, and SVM.
